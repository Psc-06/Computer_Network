# On Again, Off Again
#### Logging in
![[Pasted image 20250713113038.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250713113045.png]]
Before you actually log in, lets take a description of the above information displayed : 
- The first line indicates you’re running the server edition of Fedora version 32.
- The second line indicates the version of the Linux Kernel (5.6.6- 300). The kernel is the core part of Linux that distributions such as Fedora version 32 are built upon.
- The third line gives you the URL of a web console you can use for many administration tasks. The web console is provided by a package called Cockpit
- The final line is the actual login prompt
==TIP==
	As a part of the installation process, you created a user account other than the root account. You should use this use account rather than the root user account whenever possible. Use the root account only when making major changes of the system's configuration. When you're doing routine work, log on as an ordinary user in order to avoid accidentally corrupting your system
#### Logging out
To logout 
Type logout and press enter 
There is another way to logout by pressing Ctrl + D
#### Shutting down
As with any OS, you should never turn off the power to a Linux server
without first properly shutting down the system. 
To shut down a Linux system, just type shutdown and press Enter.
You'll be informed of the exact time of the shutdown, like this![[Pasted image 20250713113458.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250713113503.png]]
If you change your mind before the minute elapses type shutdown -c and press enter
To shut down immediately type shutdown now and press enter
To schedule a shutdown type shutdown (any time) and press enter
### Wait, Where's the Desktop
Because a GUI consumes a lot of system resources (CPU and RAM) that could be better spent on true server functions such as sharing files, running web services or database services, or handling other mundane server tasks like Domain Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS). 
Without the overhead of a GUI, Linux can devote all its resources to server processes.
### Playing the Shell Game
Most Linux Server administration is done from a console, also called a terminal, which is the Linux equivalent to a Windows command window.
A console is a text-based screen that lets you interact with a program called a shell, which reads and executes command
Teletype consoles gave way to CRT consoles, which worked pretty much like teletype machines but didn’t waste paper. The operator typed commands, which appeared on the CRT screen. 
The computer then executed the commands and displayed the results on the screen.
Unix didn’t really care whether the operator was using a teletype or a CRT console.
The prompt you see in a command window is generated by the shell
==TECHINCAL STUFF==
	A variety of shells are available in Linux, but the most common is called Bash. which stands for Bourne Again SHell
Bash is the default shell used on most Linux distributions
## Getting into Virtual Consoles
Linux is multiuser system, it lets you work with more than one console
You can actually open six virtual consoles
You can switch to a particular virtual console by pressing
Ctrl + Alt + F1 through Ctrl + Alt + F6
# Using a Remote Console
You can easily access the console of a Linux server remotely by using a handy terminal emulator program called PuTTY.
On a Windows computer, the easiest (and safest) way to get PuTTY is to open the Windows Store, search for PuTTY, and then install it.
CONFIGURATION SCREEN OF PUTTY![[Pasted image 20250713120854.png]]
Enter the IP address of your Linux Server and then click Open. PuTTY opens a console window that prompts you to log in ![[Pasted image 20250713120929.png]]
## Enabling the root User
The root user is the ultimate administrator account in a Linux system.
By default, the root account is disabled when you install Fedora Server
![[Pasted image 20250713121052.png]]
Linux responds by prompting you for your own password. When you enter that, you’re prompted to enter the new password for the root account twice. If the passwords match, you’ll see this message
![[Pasted image 20250713121117.png]]
This msg is Linux's way of telling you the password has been reset
The Root account is now enabled and can be used when necessary
==WARNING==
	Avoid logging in to Linux as the root user. Doing so grants total control of the Linux system to the session. And that can be dangerous. Instead, log in using a standard user account, and use the sudo command (described in the next section) to do things that require root privileges.
## Using the sudo command
The sudo command is required because many Linux administrative commands can only be run by the root user.
Sudo is an essential tool for Linux administration
The dnf command is used to install new software on a Linux system
The dnf command is one of those commands that can only be run by the root user.
![[Pasted image 20250713121338.png]]
#### Understanding the file system
The Linux file system is a bit different from  the windows file system
Two of the most obvious differences are actually superficial :
- Linux uses forward slashes rather than backward slashes to separate directories. Thus, /home/doug is a valid path in Linux; \Windows\System32 is a valid path in Windows.
- Linux filenames don't use extensions. You can use periods within a filename, but unlike Windows, the final period doesn't identify a file extension.
#### Looking at top-level directories
Another important aspect of the Linux file system is that the directories that compose a Linux system are governed by a standard called the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
This standard spells out which directories a Linux file systems should have
TOP LEVEL DIRECTORIES IN A LINUX FILE SYSTEM
![[Pasted image 20250713121718.png]]
There are two other directories  and that are : 
- The home directory: Every user in Linux has a home directory, which is located at /home/. Thus, /home/dlowe is the home directory for user dlowe.
  The home directory is represented by the tilde character (~)
==TECHINICAL STUFF==
	The one expectation to this rule is the root user. This special user's home directory is a top-level directory named root rather than a directory beneath the home directory
- The root directory : The root directory that's at the very top of the file system
==TECHNICAL STUFF==
	In Windows, each mounted drive has its own root directory, indicated by a backslash following the drive letter. For example, C:\ is the root directory of the C: drive. In short, each drive in Windows has its own file system. In contrast, a Linux computer has a single file system.
In Linux, the ultimate administrator account is named root. 
The root user has a special home directory named root. 
The word root is also used to refer to the top directory in the Linux file system.
This directory technically doesn't have a name — it’s just represented by a single forward slash (/).
#### Browsing the file system
To browse in the file system there are common commands and that are : 
- pwd: Displays the name of the current directory.
- ls: Displays the contents of the current directory.
- cd: Navigates to a different directory.
# Using the RPM Package Manager
The tool use to deploy software on a Linux system is called a package manager.
A package manager is a collection of tools that are designed to install packages 
Two distinct package managers have become popular on Linux systems : 
- DEB: The standard software deployment tool used on Debian variations of Linux.
- RPM: The standard used on Red Hat variations of Linux. Fedora is in the Red Hat camp
### Listing packages
To list all the packages that are installed on the server
Type dnf list installed
![[Pasted image 20250713122437.png]]
The tree lines with the dot represents a few hundred additional packages
To list all the packages that are available via the repository
Type dnf list available![[Pasted image 20250713122527.png]]
Searching the web for Fedora FTP, you'll find that the most commonly used packages are proftpd and vsftpd
According to Fedora, the preferred FTP server is vsftpd
#### Installing packages
To install a package, use the dnf install command
To install vsftpd package 
type sudo install vsftpd.x86_64
Press enter
#### Removing Packages
To remove a package from your server
![[Pasted image 20250713123212.png]]
#### Updating packages
To check whether the package got the update or not use the command
dnf check-update 
press enter
To update the package
Type dnf update
Press Enter
# Editing Text Files with VI
The most popular text editor on Linux is called Vi
### Starting Vi
To create a new text file with Vi, ![[Pasted image 20250713123438.png]]
This open Vi![[Pasted image 20250713123446.png]]
If the filename you provide on the vi command represents a file that already exists, Vi will open the file and display its content.![[Pasted image 20250713123524.png]]
As we can see at the bottom line that this file is only read only to remove the read only limitation 
Prefix the vi command with the file path, like this
![[Pasted image 20250713123629.png]]
### Saving changes and quitting Vi
COMMANDS TO SAVE & EXIT
![[Pasted image 20250713123745.png]]
All the four commands start with the colon so don't forget to put it.
### Understanding Vi's operating modes
There are two basic operating modes in VI
- Command mode
- Input mode
The vi editor starts up in command mode, which means that if you just start typing, you won't be entering text into the file. 
Instead you'll be entering commands
Input mode lets you type text that become a part of the file.
To switch from input mode back to command mode, just press escape
### Moving around in a file
The easiest way to move the cursor around in Vi is to use the arrow keys.
You can also use the End key to move to the end of the current line or the Home key to move to the start of the current line.
COMMANDS FOR MOVING THE CURSOR
![[Pasted image 20250713124040.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250713124045.png]]
### Inserting Text
COMMANDS FOR INSERTING TEXT
![[Pasted image 20250713124110.png]]
When you use these commands, Vi is switched to input mode where you can type the text to be inserted
When you're finished press the Escape key to return to command mode
### Changing Text
For example, if you use the command C, all characters from the cursor position to the end of the line are deleted; then, Vi switches to input mode so you can enter the text you want to replace the text you deleted.

![[Pasted image 20250713124359.png]]
COMMANDS FOR DELETING TEXT
![[Pasted image 20250713124409.png]]
### Copying & Pasting text
in Vi, the common operations of copying and pasting text are called yank and put
& what we would normally call the clipboard is called the buffer
Whenever you delete text, the text that is deleted is placed in the buffer. This is the equivalent of what we call cutting.

![[Pasted image 20250713124544.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250713124548.png]]
### Repeating commands
There are two ways you can repeat a command in vi. 
- The first is to press the period (.) key
  This repeats the command most recently executed
- Another way to repeat a command is to use a prefix any of the command ![[Pasted image 20250713124723.png]]

# Using Cockpit
Cockpit is a web-based administration tool that dramatically simplifies the job of managing a Linux server
You can use Cockpit to manage the server remotely via that computer's browser
Cockpit is installed and enabled by default in Fedora Server 32  You can confirm that by the message that’s displayed when you first log in to Fedora:
![[Pasted image 20250713124949.png]]
Here you can see the web console (that's cockpit) is available at https://10.0.0.131:9090
If you don't see this message when you log in, you'll need to install and enable cockpit manually. 
Follow these steps to install 
1. Install Cockpit with the following command![[Pasted image 20250713125104.png]]
2. Enable Cockpit with the following command
   ![[Pasted image 20250713125122.png]]
To access cockpit, open a web browser on another computer in the same network and browse to the IP URL listed  in the login message
![[Pasted image 20250713125206.png]]
Login using your Linux username and password
COCKPIT'S HOME PAGE
![[Pasted image 20250713125233.png]]
The navigation pane on the left side of Cockpit lets you access several administrative centers
- Overview: The overview page.
- Logs: Review events recorded in the Linux logs.
- Storage: Review and manage storage devices attached to your server.
- Networking: Review and manage network devices on your server.
- Accounts : Review and manage user accounts on the server
- Services : Review and manage Linux services
- Software Updates : Update packages installed on your server
- Terminal : Opens a terminal window through which you can enter Linux commands
  ![[Pasted image 20250713125425.png]]
## Managing User accounts
Each Linux user account has the following information associated with it : 
- Username: The name the user types to log on to the Linux system.
- Full name: The user’s full name.
- Home directory: The directory that the user is placed in when he or she logs on. In Fedora, the default home directory is /home/username. For example, if the username is blowe, the home directory is /home/blowe.
- Shell: The program used to process Linux commands. Several shell programs are available. In most distributions, the default shell is /bin/bash.
- Group: You can create group accounts, which make it easy to apply identical access rights to groups of users.
- User ID: The internal identifier for the user.
You can add a new user by using the useradd command
To create a new user 
Open a terminal window and type this command
![[Pasted image 20250713125614.png]]
Before the account can be used, you must set the account password 
To do that enter the following command
![[Pasted image 20250713125645.png]]
We can also use cockpit to manage user accounts 
![[Pasted image 20250713125705.png]]
Here you can see the server has two accounts already
- dlowe
- root
You can click an account to see the account details
![[Pasted image 20250713125732.png]]
You can also create a new user account by clicking create new account on the accounts page![[Pasted image 20250713125758.png]]
