Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service that provides a ton of alternatives for virtualizing your IT infrastructure in the cloud.
Azure has been around since 2010 and is now one of the most platforms for building IT in the cloud.
Azure provides three basic types of cloud services : 
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Cloud-hosted versions of the most basic types of virtual infrastructure components, including virtual machines (VMs), virtual disk storage, and virtual networks. With IaaS, Microsoft provides the physical hardware needed to run basic Hyper-V components.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): A step up from IaaS, PaaS provides cloud-based platforms on which you can run applications. For example, you can deploy web-based ASP.NET applications to Azure and let Microsoft worry about managing the infrastructure needed to run the application.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Fully functional software applications that you simply subscribe to.
==TECHNICAL STUFF==
	In case you're interested, the color azure is technically midway between blue and cyan. It's generally thought of as the color the sky on a beautiful clear day. It gets its name from the mineral lapis lazuli, which has a striking blue color. The first use of the word azure in English came from none other than Geoffrey Chaucer in his 1374 poem Troilus and Criseyde
## Looking at Azure Services
Most popular and useful services are :
- VMs : Allow you to create and run fully functional VMs on Azure's cloud platform. The VMs can run Microsoft Windows Server operating system or Linux. For windows server machines, the operating system license cost is included in the price of the VM.
	Microsoft has a nice estimating tool that can help you eliminate surprises
- Storage : Allows you to create various types of storage resources, including simple disks, file systems, network-attached storage (NAS), and backup storage.
- Networking: Lets you create virtual networks that enable your Azure cloud components to communicate with one another and also with your physical network.
- Web applications: Azure can host complete web apps that can be developed using many popular programming platforms, including ASP.NET, Java, PHP, Node.js, Python, and HTML5. When you deploy an Azure Web App, Azure takes care of the details of managing the web server VM, so you can focus on the application itself.
- Mobile applications: Enables you to create and deploy native or cross-platform mobile apps for iOS and Android. If you’re looking for a way to create custom mobile applications for your company, the Azure Mobile App service is a good place to start.
- SQL database: Allows you to create a SQL Server database without setting up a dedicated VM to run SQL Server.

==REMEMBER==
	Note that all these services are free for a period of one year. After the first year, normal charges are incurred
==TIP==
	The nuances of what services are free under the free account are detailed and of course, subject to change. So check out the FAQ available during the signup process to be sure you understand what's free and what isn't 
## Examining the Azure Portal
AZURE PORTAL 
![[Pasted image 20250707221506.png]]
Across the top of the azure portal is a toolbar that contains a search box as well as several useful icons : 
- Shell: Displays the Azure command shell, which lets you manage Azure using PowerShell or Linux Bash commands.
- Directory + Subscriptions: Lets you switch among the directories and subscriptions you have set up. (Initially, there won’t be any.)
- Notifications: Displays any recent notifications generated by Azure.
- Settings: Lets you configure portal settings.
- Help: Provides access to useful Azure Help pages.
- Feedback: Allows you to send feedback to the Azure team.
## Creating a windows virtual machine
To create a windows virtual machine follow these steps : 
1. Click + Create a resource
	![[Pasted image 20250707221654.png]]
2. Click Windows Server 2016 Datacenter
	![[Pasted image 20250707221710.png]]
3. Enter the Project details 
	The project details include the following information
	- Subscription: If you have more than one subscription, select it from the drop-down list.
	- Resource Group : Each subscription can have multiple resource groups, which can simplify management if you have numerous VMs. You need at least one resource group, so click the create new link and enter a name to use for the resource group, then click ok in the pop-up that appears
4. Enter the instance details
	The instance details include the following information:
	- Name: Enter the computer name you want to use for this VM.
	- Region: The region where you would like your VM to be located. Scroll through the list to see the available options. In most cases, you’ll want to choose the location that best describes your own location.
	- Availability Options: This setting lets you control how much redundancy should be provided for your VM. For our purposes, change this setting to No Infrastructure Redundancy Required.
	- Image: This setting lets you choose the Windows Server installation image to use. For our purposes, change this setting to Windows Server 2019 Data Center – Gen1.
	- Azure Spot Instance: This check box lets you select a cost saving option that runs your VM only when capacity is available. Your VM may occasionally be interrupted by other workloads. Because we’re running under a free trial period, we’ll skip this option.
	- Size: This option lets you select the VM size. For this example, choose Standard.
5. Enter the administrator account details
6. Enter the inbound port rules
7. Select licensing details
8. Click Next: disks 
	![[Pasted image 20250707222106.png]]
9. Click create and attach a new disk 
	The following information is required to create a data disk
	- Name: The default value supplied is usually appropriate.
	- Source type: Choose None (Empty Disk).
	- Size: The default is 1TB of Premium SSD. If you want to change the size or use a less expensive disk type, click Change Size.
	- Encryption type: The default is Encryption at Rest with Platform-Managed Key, which is the easiest to manage.
	- Enable shared disk: This advanced feature lets the disk be attached to more than one VM. Unless you have experience with this feature, you should leave it set to No.
10. Click Next : Networking
	![[Pasted image 20250707222229.png]]
11. Click Review + create

12. Click Create
## Managing an Azure Virtual Machine
THE AZURE DASHBOARD
![[Pasted image 20250707222351.png]]
In the all resources section, you can see the resources that were created for the VM created in the previous section : 
- NETAIO-01: The VM that was just created
- NETAIO-01-ip: A public IP address that has been allocated to the VM
- NETAIO-01-nsg: A network security group that was automatically created to manage the server’s security netaio-01362: The server’s network interface
- NETAIO-01_DataDisk_0: The data disk that was created for the VM.
- NETAIO-01_OsDisk_1_5d28b…: The OS disk that was created for the VM.
- NETAIO-vnet: A virtual network that was created and to which the VM was added
![[Pasted image 20250707222510.png]]
Across the top of the VM's resource page, you'll find a strip of icons useful for managing the machine
- Connect: lets you connect to the VM
- Start : Start the VM, if it isn't already running
- Restart: Restarts the VM
- Stop : Stops the VM
- Capture : Creates an image of the VM. You can later use this image to create a new VM
- Delete : Deletes the VM
- Refresh : Updates the display with current information
- Open in mobile : Displays a QR code which you can scan to open the VM in the Azure mobile app, which you should first install on your mobile phone
RESIZING AN AZURE VIRTUAL MACHINE

## Connecting to an Azure Virtual Machine
When an Azure VM is up and running, you can connect to it remotely using remote desktop connection, just as you can connect to any other VM. The easiest way to do so is to follow these steps : 
1. Open the VM in the dashboard
2. Click Connect in the toolbar and choose RDP (Remote desktop connection)
	![[Pasted image 20250707222915.png]]
3. Click download RDP file (.rdp)
4. Save the downloaded RDP file to a convenient location
5. Click the downloaded RDP file to open the connection
6. Enter the username and password for the administrator account you specified when you created the machine, and then click OK.
==WARNING==
	When you're finished exploring the Azure VM and you've learned what you need to know, don't forget to delete the VM from the Azure environment before the free subscription period expires. if you forget, you may find unexpected charges on your credit card
