## Configuring Network Printers
==TIP==
	Before you configure a network printer to work with network clients, read the client configuration section of the manual that came with the printer. Many printers come with special software that provides more advanced printing and networking features than the standard features provided by Windows. If so, you may want to install the printer manufacturer’s software on your client computers rather than use the standard Windows network printer support.

==TIP==
	If you're experienced with the devices and printers page from previous editions of windows, you'll be happy to know that you can still get to that page. Just scroll down to the bottom of devices settings page and click devices and printers in the related settings section. This brings up the familiar devices and printers page, which lists the printers available on your computer. 
From this page you can right click a printer and choose any of the following options:
- See what's printing : Displays the list of files that are currently being printer
- Set as default printer : Sets the selected printer as the default printer
- Printing Preferences : Sets the printing defaults for this printer
- Printer Properties : Displays and sets the basic printer properties such as the printer's name, its port and driver and so on
- Remove Device : Removes the printer
## Accessing a network using a web interface
==TIP==
	Printers that have a direct network connection often include a built-in web server that lets you manage the printer from any browser on the network. This web interface lets you view the status information about the printer and check the printer's configuration. You can even view error logs to find our how often the printer jams

To call up a printer's web interface, enter its IP address or host name in the address bar of any web browser
To view the information or change the configuration details such as TCP/IP host name, IP address, subnet mask, domain name and so on click on the networking settings page

==TIP==
	As the network administrator, you may need to visit the printer's web page frequently. I suggest that you add it to your browser's Favorites menu so that you can get to it easily. if you have several printers, add them to a folder named Network Printers
