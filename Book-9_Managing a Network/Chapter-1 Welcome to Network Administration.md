# Knowing What Network Administrators Do
Network administrators administer networks, which means that they take care of the tasks of installing, configuring, expanding, protecting, upgrading, tuning and repairing the network.
All network administrators must attend to several common chores:
- Equipment upgrades: The network administrator should be involved in every decision to purchase new computers, printers, or other equipment. In particular, the network administrator should be prepared to lobby for the most network-friendly equipment possible, including professional-grade network switchers and firewalls, ample storage capacity, reliable servers, and an adequate backup system.
- Configuration: The network administrator must put on the pocket protector whenever a new computer is added to the network. The network administrator’s job includes considering what changes to make to the cabling configuration, what computer name to assign to the new computer, how to integrate the new user into the security system, what rights to grant the user, and so on.
- Software upgrades: Every once in a while, your trusty network vendors release new versions of their software. The network administrator must study up on the new version and decide whether its new features are beneficial enough to warrant an upgrade. In most cases, the hardest part of upgrading to a new version of network software is determining the migration path — that is, how to upgrade your entire network to the new version while disrupting the network or its users as little as possible. Plan carefully!
- Patches: Between upgrades, Microsoft releases patches and service packs that fix minor problems with its server operating systems.
- Performance maintenance: One of the easiest traps that you can get sucked into is the quest for network speed. The network is never fast enough, and users always blame the hapless network manager. So the administrator spends hours and hours tuning and tweaking the network to squeeze out that last 2 percent of performance.
- Ho-hum chores: Network administrators perform routine chores, such as backing up the servers, archiving old data, freeing up server hard drive space, and so on. Much of network administration is making sure that things keep working and finding and correcting problems before any users notice that something is wrong. In this sense, network administration can be a thankless job.
- Software inventory: Network administrators are also responsible for gathering, organizing, and tracking the entire network’s software inventory.
## Choosing the Part-Time Administrator
Some additional ideas on picking a part-time network administrator
- The network administrator needs to be an organized person
- Allow enough time for network administration
- Make sure that everyone knows who the network administrator is and that the network administrator has the authority to make decisions about the network, such as what access rights each user has, what files can and can't be stored on the server, how often backups are done and so on
- Pick someone who is assertive and willing to irritate people. A good network administrator should make sure that backups are working before a hard drive fails and make sure that antivirus protection is in place before a virus wipes out the entire network.
  This policing will irritate people, but it's for their own good
- The person who installs the network is also the network administrator
- The network administrator needs an understudy someone who knows almost as much about the network, is eager to make a mark and smiles when the worst network jobs are delegated
- The network administrator has some sort of official title, such as Network Boss, Network Czar, Vice President in Charge of Network Operations, or Dr. Network. A badge, a personalized pocket protector, or a set of Spock ears helps, too.
## Establishing Routine Chores
The routine chores that network administrators do is :
- Backup : The network administrator needs to make sure that the network is properly backed up
- Protection : Another major task for network administrators is sheltering your network from the evils of the outside world
- Clean-Up : Users think that the network server is like the attic: They want to throw files up there and leave them forever. No matter how much storage your network has, your users will fill it up sooner than you think. So the network manager gets the fun job of cleaning up the attic once in a while.
## Managing Network Users
Managing network technology is the easiest part of network management
Some tips for dealing with the users : 
- Training : Training is a key part of the network manager's job
- Respect : Never treat your network users like they're idiots
- Aids : Make up a network cheat sheet that contains everything that user needs to know about using the network on one page
- Responsive : Be as Responsive as possible when a network user complains of a network problem. If you don't fix the problem soon the user may try to fix it. You probably don't want that
## Patching Up Your Operating System & Software
For all versions of Windows, you can use Windows Update to apply
patches to keep your operating system and other Microsoft software up
to date.
For larger networks, you can set up a server that runs Microsoft’s Windows Software Update Services (WSUS) to automate software updates. WSUS, which is a built-in role on Windows Server 2012 and later, essentially lets you set up your own Windows Update site on your own network. Then, you have complete control over how software updates are delivered to the computers on your network. 
## Discovering Software Tools for Network Administrators
Sample of some tools that a network administrators should have :
- A diagramming tool : A diagramming tool lets you draw pictures of your network. Visio is great for drawing the types of diagrams 
- A network discovery program : For larger network you  may want to invest in a network discovery program such as spiceworks that can automatically document your network's structure for you.
  These programs scan the network carefully, looking for computers, printers, routers, and other devices. They then create a database of the network components, draw diagrams for you, and chug out helpful reports
- The network's built-in tools: Many software tools that you need to manage a network come with the network itself,
  For example, Windows include a net diag command that you can use to make sure that all the computers on a network can communicate with each other
  For TCP/IP networks, you can use the TCP/IP diagnostic commands  ![[Pasted image 20250715104121.png]]
- System information : This program that comes with Windows is a useful utility for network managers
- A protocol analyzer : A protocol analyzer monitors and logs the individual packets that travel along your network (Protocol analyzers are also called packet sniffers)
  Most network administrators agree with Wireshark is the best protocol analyzer available
- Network Monitor : All current version of windows include network monitor, Which provides basic protocol analysis and can often help solve pesky network problems

## Getting Certified
You can pursue two basic types of certification: vendor-specific
certification and vendor-neutral certification. 
The major software vendors such as Microsoft and Cisco provide certification programs for their own equipment and software. 
CompTIA, a nonprofit industry trade association, provides the best-known vendor-neutral certification.
#### CompTIA
CompTIA is a source for a variety of well-respected network certifications : 
- A+ is a basic certification for an entry-level computer technician. To attain A+ certification, you have to pass two exams: one on computer hardware, the other on operating systems.
- Linux+ covers basic Linux skills such as installation, operations, and troubleshooting. This certification is vendor neutral, so it doesn’t depend on any particular version of Linux.
- Network+ is a popular vendor-neutral networking certification. It covers four major topic areas: Media and Topologies, Protocols and Standards, Network Implementation, and Network Support.
- Server+ covers network server hardware. It includes details such as installing and upgrading server hardware, installing and configuring an NOS, and so on.
- Cloud+ covers building cloud infrastructure.
- Security+ is for security specialists. The exam topics include general security concepts, communication security, infrastructure security, basics of cryptography, and operational/organizational security.
#### Microsoft
 Microsoft offers dozen of certifications that cover all aspects of Microsoft software offerings.
 The solutions are role based, targeting nine types of IT roles
- Administrator
- AI engineer
- Data engineer
- Data scientist
- Developer
- DevOps engineer
- Functional consultant
- Security engineer
- Solutions architect
Within each of these roles a variety of certifications are available. 
Most fall into one of three categories
- Fundamentals
- Associate
- Expert
#### Cisco
Cisco offers some of the most respected certifications available for those
who need to work extensively with Cisco equipment.
Here are some of the more popular Cisco certifications:
- CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) is an entry-level apprentice certification. A CCNA should be able to install, configure, and operate Cisco equipment for small networks (under 100 nodes).
- CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional) is a professional-level certification for Cisco equipment. A CCNP should be able to install, configure, and troubleshoot Cisco networks of virtually any size. Several variants are available for cloud, data center, routing, security, service provider, and routing.

- CCIE (Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert) is an expert-level certification, which can be had in several varieties, including routing, security, wireless, and service provider.
- CCAr: (Cisco Certified Architect) is the top dog of Cisco certifications.
- CCT (Cisco Certified Technician) is a certification for those who can diagnose and repair Cisco equipment.
- And much more! There are many more Cisco certifications to choose from, including certification for security, voice technology, wireless networking, and more.
## Gurus Need Gurus Too
As the local computer guru, one of your most valuable assets can be a
knowledgeable friend who’s a notch or two above you on the geek scale.
That way, when you run into a real stumper, you have a friend to call for
advice. Here are some tips for handling your own guru:
- In dealing with your own guru, don’t forget the Computer Geek’s Golden Rule: “Do unto your guru as you would have your own users do unto you.” Don’t pester your guru with simple stuff that you just haven’t spent the time to think through. If you have thought it through and can’t come up with a solution, however, give your guru a call. Most computer experts welcome the opportunity to tackle an unusual computer problem. It’s a genetic defect.
- If you don’t already know someone who knows more about computers than you do, consider joining your local PC users’ group. The group may even have a subgroup that specializes in your networking software or may be devoted entirely to local folks who use the same networking software that you use. Odds are good that you’re sure to make a friend or two at a users’ group meeting. Also, you can probably convince your boss to pay any fees required to join the group.
- If you can’t find a real-life guru, try to find an online guru. Check out the various computing newsgroups on the Internet. Subscribe to online newsletters that are automatically delivered to you via email.
