## Introducing Cloud Computing
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to overcome one or more of your networked computing resource to the internet
#### Difference between the cloud & traditional way
- Email Services
	- Traditional : Provide email services by installing Microsoft exchange on a local sever computer
	- Cloud : contract with an internet-based email provider such as google mail (Gmail).
- Disk Storage
	- Traditional : Set up a local file server computer with a large amount of shared disk space
	- Cloud : Sign up for an internet file storage service and then store your data on the internet
- Accounting Services
	- Traditional : Purchase expensive accounting software and install it on a local server
	- Cloud : Sign up for a web-based accounting service. Then all your accounting data is saved and managed on the provider's server, not yours

### Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Cost-Effective
- Scalable
==REMEMBER==
	With cloud computing you pay only for the capacity you're actually using, and you can add capacity whenever you need it. In the file server example you can write as much data as you need to the cloud storage. Each month, you're billed according to your actual usage. Thus you don't have to purchase and install additional task drives to add storage capacity
 - Reliable
 - Hassle-free
 - Globally accessible 
### Drawbacks of Cloud Computing
- Entrenched applications : There are the application that do no allow cloud computing 
- Internet connection speed
- Internet connection reliability : The cloud resource you access may feature all the redundancy in the world, but if your user access the cloud through a single internet connection, that connection becomes a key point of vulnerability. 
	-Two ways to Mitigate the risk are  :
	- Make sure that you're using an enterprise-class internet connection. Enterprise-class connections are more expensive but provide much better fault tolerance and repair service than consumer-class connections do
	- Provide redundant connections if you can. That way, if one connection fails, traffic can be rerouted through alternative connections
- Security Threats
## Basic Kinds of cloud services
There are three distinct kinds of services that can be provided via the cloud applications, platforms and services (infrastructure)
#### Applications
Also referred to as Software as a service (SaaS) fully functional application can be delivered via the cloud
Another example if G suite (formally known as google apps) which is a suite of cloud based office applications designed to complete directly with MS-Office applications 
#### Platforms
Also referred to as Platform as a Service (PaaS)
This class of service refers to providers that give you access to a remote virtual operating platform on which you can build your own applications
If you use a web provider to host your company's website you're already using PaaS
One of the best known examples of this type of PaaS provider is Amazon
==REMEMBER==
	When you use PaaS, you take on the responsibility of developing your own custom applications to run on the remote platform. The PaaS provider takes care of the details of maintaining the platform itself, including the base operating system and the hardware on which the platform runs
#### Infrastructure
Also referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). 
This class of service provides you access to a remote virtual machine

## Public Clouds V/s Private Clouds
Public cloud means that the services that are available to anyone in the world via the internet.
G suite is an example of public cloud service 
One of the drawbacks of public cloud services is that they're inherently insecure. Another drawback is that it is dependent on high-speed, reliable internet connections

A private cloud mimics many of the features of cloud computing but it is implemented on private hardware within a local network, and it isn't accessible to the general public
They are more secure And they are also dependent only on private network connections

There is newcomer to cloud computing which is hybrid cloud which combines the feature of public and private clouds. Typically, a hybrid cloud system uses a small private cloud that provides local access to some of the applications and the public cloud for others. You might maintain your most frequently used data on a private cloud for fast access via the local network and use the public cloud to store archives and other less frequently used data, for which performance isn’t as much of an issue.

### Major Cloud Providers
##### Amazon 
It is the largest provider of cloud services in the world
It launched its cloud platform Amazon web services (AWS) in 2006
AWS includes the following features
- Amazon CloudFront : A PaaS content-delivery system designed to deliver web contents to large number of user (its kind of warehouse in the internet world globally so that users can buy the products)
- Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud : Also called Amazon EC2. An IaaS system that provides access to raw computing power (Amazon provides virtual machine to provide products to the consumer)
- Amazon Simple Storage Service : Also called Amazon S3 provides web-based data storage for unlimited amounts of data
- Amazon Simple Queue Service : Also called Amazon SQS. Provides a data transfer system that lets applications send message to other applications. SQS enables you to build applications that work together
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud ; Also called Amazon VPC uses a VPN connections to connect your local network to Amazon's cloud services
##### Google
- G Suite : It is a replacement for Microsoft office that provides basic email word processing via the cloud. 
- Google Drive  : A cloud based solution that lets you work with the google cloud data directly form within Microsoft Office applications
- Google App Engine : A PaaS interface that lets your develop you r own application that work with Google's cloud services
- Google Cloud print : Allows you to connect your printer to the cloud so that they can be accessed form anywhere
- Google maps : A Global information System (GIS)
##### Microsoft
- Microsoft Office 365 : It s a cloud based version of MS-Office that can be access from anywhere to cloud-based emails, web conferencing, file sharing and office web apps 
- Windows Azure : A PaaS offering that lets you build websites, deploy virtual machines that run windows server or Linux or access cloud versions of server applications such as SQL servers
