# What is Teams?
Teams is a chat-based online collaboration platform that is designed for people who work together on a common project
Teams has two distinct modes of operation : 
- ad-hoc chat, in which two or more people connect for a brief conversation
  In this type of chat users can exchange files, start an audio call or an online meeting, and invite other people into the chat
  They are ephemeral in nature, when the topic of the chat has been resolved, the chat comes to an end ![[Pasted image 20250711210045.png]]
- Organized teams, In Microsoft Teams, a team is designed space where a group of users come together for ongoing work  ![[Pasted image 20250711210127.png]]
Teams are organized around three basic concepts
- Team: A team is a virtual workspace where a group of people gather to collaborate and communicate. Some teams are organization-wide, so the entire company participates in them. Other teams are group specific, so membership is limited to specific people. Each of our production groups (Land Services, ExpandEV, Education & Healthcare, and so on) has its own team.
- Channel: A channel is an organized topic within a team. All activities within a team take place in a channel. The most noticeable activity in a channel is chatting, which provides a way to have online conversations about the channel’s topic. But that’s not all that can happen in a channel — you can use channel tabs to access other channel features as well (see the next bullet point).
  All teams have a top-level channel called General, which is where conversations about the team itself occur. For example, messages are automatically generated in the
- Tabs : Each channel has a row of tabs that provide access to different features of the channel. All channels have a Posts tab, which is where chatting occurs, and a Files tab, which is a place to save files of interest to the channel. Other tabs may appear as well.
==REMEMBER==
	Tabs are specific to channels. Each channel within a team has its own set of tabs.

## A Brief Look at How Teams Works
Teams is an exquisitely complicated product that is built on a solid layer of various features provided by Office 365 and Azure

### Microsoft 365 Group
A Microsoft 365 Group is the organizing principle around which teams are created
With a Microsoft 365 Group, you can provide access to a collection of shared resources, including the following:
- A team in Microsoft Teams
- A modern SharePoint site in SharePoint
- The SharePoint Document Library
- A shared mailbox in Outlook
- A shared calendar
- A OneNote notebook
When you create a team in Microsoft Teams, a Microsoft 365 Group is automatically created, and the resources detailed in the preceding list are automatically provisioned for the group.

### SharePoint
When you create a team in Microsoft Teams, two critical components of SharePoint are also created : 
- A modern SharePoint site, which provides a basic SharePoint page for the team
- The SharePoint Document Library, which provides a library for storing files related to the team
A MODERN SHAREPOINT SITE IS CREATED FOR EVERY TEAM![[Pasted image 20250711210938.png]]
The SharePoint Document library plays a key role in the operation of Microsoft Teams, because it's the repository used for all files stored for the team

THE SHAREPOITN DOCUMENT LIBRARY CAN BE ADDED AS A TAB TO ANY TEAM CHANNEL

### OneDrive for Business
When a user posts a file to the Files tab in a chat, the file is uploaded to
that user’s OneDrive for Business. Then, the file is shared with everyone
else on the chat.
