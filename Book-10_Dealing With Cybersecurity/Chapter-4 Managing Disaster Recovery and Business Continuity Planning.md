The trendy term for disaster planning is business continuity planning (BCP)
# Assessing Different Types of Disaster
One of the first steps in developing a business continuity plan is to assess the risk of the various types of disasters that may affect your organization.
### Environment Disasters
Environmental disasters are what most people think of first when they think of disaster recovery. Some types of environmental disasters are regional. Others can happen pretty much anywhere.
- Fire
- Earthquakes
- Weather
- Water
- Lightning
### Deliberate Disasters
Some disasters are the result of deliberate actions by others
For example : 
- Intentional damage
- Theft
- Terrorism
==REMEMBER==
	Don’t neglect the possibility of sabotage. A disgruntled employee who gets hold of an administrator’s account and password can do all sorts of nasty things to your network.
### Disruption of Services
You may not realize just how much your business depends on the delivery of services and utilities. A BCP should take into consideration how you will deal with the loss of certain services:
- No juice: Electrical power is crucial for computers and other types of equipment. During a power failure once (I live in California, so I’m used to it), I discovered that I can’t even work with pencil and paper because all my pencil sharpeners are electric. Electrical outages are not uncommon, but the technology to deal with them is readily available. Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) equipment is reliable and inexpensive.
- No Communications
- No water : An interruption in the water supply may not shut down your computers, but it can disrupt your business by forcing you to close your facility until the water supply is reestablished.
### Equipment failure
Modern companies depend on many different types of equipment for their daily operations. 
The failure of any of these key systems can disrupt business until the systems are repaired:
- Computer equipment failure can obviously affect business
operations.
- Air-conditioning systems are crucial to regulate temperatures, especially in computer rooms. Computer equipment can be damaged if the temperature climbs too high.
- Elevators, automatic doors, and other equipment may also be necessary for your business.
### Other Disasters
You should assess many other potential disasters. Here are just a few:
- Labor disputes
- Loss of key staff because of resignation, injury, sickness, or death
- Workplace violence
- Public health issues, such as epidemics, mold infestations, and so on
- Loss of a key supplier
- Nearby disaster, such as a fire or police action across the street that results in your business being temporarily blocked off
## Analyzing the Impact of a Disaster
The first step is to identify the key business processes that can be impacted by different types of disasters. 
These business processes are different for each company. 
For example, here are a few of the key business processes for a publishing company:
- Editorial, such as managing projects through the process of technical editing, copyediting, and production
- Acquisition, such as determining product development strategies, recruiting authors, and signing projects
- Human resource, such as payroll, hiring, employee review, and recruiting
- Marketing, including sales tracking, developing marketing materials, sponsoring sales conferences, and exhibiting at trade events
- Sales and billing, such as filling customer orders, maintaining the company website, managing inventory, and handling payments
- Executive and financial, such as managing cash flow, securing credit, raising capital, deciding when to go public, and deciding when to buy a smaller publisher or sell out to a bigger publisher
One common way to assess the impact of business process loss is to rate the impact of various degrees of loss for each process
## Developing a Business Continuity Plan
A BCP is simply a plan for how you will continue operation of your key business processes should the normal operation of the process fail
The key to a BCP is redundancy of each component that is essential to your business processes 
These components include :
- Facilities
- Computer Equipment
==WARNING==
	Always keep a current set of backup media at an alternate location
- Phones 
  Disaster planning is a very good reason to use a cloud phone provider rather than maintain an on-premises phone system (often called a private branch exchange, or PBX, system).
- Staff
- Stationery
- Hard copy files
## Holding a Fire Drill
The most basic type of disaster recovery drill is a simple test of your network backup procedures.
You achieve several benefits by restoring files on a regular basis : 
- Taps are unreliable
- Backup Programs are confusing to configure
- Restoring your files can be a little confusing, especially when you use a combination of normal and incremental or differential backups
