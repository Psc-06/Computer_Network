## Working With Cable
Most ethernet Networks are built using twisted-pair cable (also known as UTP cable)
### Cable Categories
Twisted-pair cable comes in various grades, or categories

#### What's with the pairs
Most twisted-pair cable has four pairs of wires, for a total of eight wires.
Standard Ethernet actually uses only two of the pairs so the other two pairs are unused.
==WARNING==
	Don't give in to temptation to use the extra pairs for some other purpose, such as for a voice line. The Electrical noise generated by voice signals in the extra wires can interface with your network.
### To shield or not to shield
Unshielded Twisted pair cable (UTP) is designed for normal office environments.
When You use UTP cable, you must be careful not to route cable close to fluorescent light fixtures, air conditioners, or electric motors (Because of the potential of electro magnetic radiation that can affect the electric circuit)
In outdoor environment or other environments with a lot of electrical interface such as factories you may want to use shielded twisted pair cable (STP)
Most STP cable is shielded by a layer of aluminum foil.
#### When to use plenum cable
The outer sheath of both shielded and unshielded twisted pair cable comes in two varieties :
- PVC : the most common and least expensive type
- ![[Pasted image 20250703095513.png]]
- Plenum : A special type of fire-retardant cable designed for use in the plenum space of a building (typically, in the hollows below a floor or above a ceiling)

#### Sometimes solid, sometimes stranded
The actual copper wire that composes the cable comes in two varieties
- Stranded cable: Each conductor is made from a bunch of very small wires twisted together. Stranded cable is more flexible than solid cable, so it doesn’t break as easily. However, stranded cable is more expensive than solid cable and isn’t very good at transmitting signals over long distances. Stranded cable is best used for patch cables, such as the cable used to connect a computer to a wall jack or the cable used to connect patch panels to hubs and switches. Strictly speaking, the cable that connects your computer to the wall jack is a station cable — not a patch cable. Patch cables are used in the wiring closet, usually to connect patch panels to switches. However, in common practice, the terms station cable and patch cable are used interchangeably.
- Solid cable: Each conductor is a single solid strand of wire. Solid cable is less expensive than stranded cable and carries signals farther, but it isn’t very flexible. If you bend it too many times, it will break. Solid cable is usually used for permanent wiring within the walls and ceilings of a building.
### Installation guidelines
General pointers to keep in mind if you decide to install cable yourself
- You can purchase twisted-pair cable in prefabricated lengths, such as 50 feet, 75 feet, or 100 feet. You can also special-order prefabricated cables in any length you need. However, attaching connectors to bulk cable isn’t that difficult. I recommend that you use prefabricated cables only for very small networks and only when you don’t need to route the cable through walls or ceilings.
- Always use a bit more cable than you need, especially if you’re running cable through walls. For example, when you run a cable up a wall, leave a few feet of slack in the ceiling above the wall. That way, you’ll have plenty of cable if you need to make a repair later on.
- When running cable, avoid sources of interference, such as fluorescent lights, big motors, x-ray machines, and so on. The most common source of interference for cables that are run behind dropped ceiling panels are fluorescent lights; be sure to give light fixtures a wide berth as you run your cable. Three feet should do it.
- The maximum allowable cable length between a hub and the computer is 100 meters (about 328 feet).
- If you must run cable across the floor where people walk, cover the cable so that no one trips over it. Inexpensive cable protectors are available at most hardware stores.
- When running cables through walls, label each cable at both ends. Most electrical supply stores carry pads of cable labels that are perfect for the job. These pads contain 50 sheets or so of precut labels with letters and numbers. They look much more professional than wrapping a loop of masking tape around the cable and writing on the tape with a marker.
- If nothing else, use a permanent marker to write directly on the cable.
- When several cables come together, tie them with plastic cable ties or better yet strips of Velcro. Don’t use masking tape or duct tape; the tape doesn’t last, but the sticky glue stuff does. It’s a mess a year later. Cable ties are available at electrical supply stores. You can purchase rolls of Velcro that you can cut to the desired lengths from online suppliers.
==TIP==
	Cable ties have all sorts of useful purposes. Once on a backpacking trip, I used a pair of cable ties to attach an unsuspecting buddy’s hat to a high tree limb. He wasn’t impressed with my innovative use of the cable ties, but my other hiking companions were.
==TIP==
	When you run cable above suspended ceiling panels, use cable ties, J-hooks, or clamps to secure the cable to the actual ceiling or to the metal frame that supports the ceiling tiles. Don’t just lay the cable on top of the tiles.
#### Pinouts for twisted-pair cables
Each pair of wires in a twisted-pair cable is one of four colors
- orange
- green
- blue
- brown
The two wires that make up each pair are complementary
One is a solid color and the other is white with a stripe of the corresponding color
Two popular standard ways of hooking up the wires are 
- ANSI/TIA 568A
- ANSI/TIA 568B also known as AT&T 258A

==WARNING==
	It doesn't matter which of these wiring schemes you use, but pick one and stick with it. If you use one wiring standard on one end of a cable and the other standard on the other end, the cable won't work
The only difference between the two wiring standards is which pair is used to transmit data and which pair is used to receive data. In the EIA/TIA 568A standard, the green pair is used to transmit and the orange pair is used to receive. In the EIA/TIA 568B and AT&T 258A standards, the orange pair is used to transmit and the green pair to receive.
### Attaching RJ-45 Connectors
Procedure for attaching an RJ-45 connector : 
1. Cut the end of the cable to the desired length.
	Make sure that you make a square cut — not a diagonal cut.
2. Insert the cable into the stripper portion of the crimp tool so that the end of the cable is against the stop.
	Squeeze the handles and slowly pull the cable out, keeping it square. This strips off the correct length of outer insulation without
	puncturing the insulation on the inner wires.
3. Arrange the wires so that they lay flat and line up
	You’ll have to play with the wires a little bit to get them to lay out in
	the right sequence.
4. Slide the wires into the pinholes on the connector.
	Double-check to make sure that all the wires slip into the correct pinholes.
5. Insert the plug and wire into the crimping portion of the tool and then squeeze the handles to crimp the plug.
	Squeeze it tight!
6. Remove the plug from the tool and double-check the connection.
	You’re done!
FEW POINTS TO REMEMBER WHEN DEALING WITH RJ-45 CONNECTORS AND TWISTED-PAIR CABLE : 
- The pins on the RJ-45 connectors aren’t numbered, but you can tell which is pin 1 by holding the connector so that the metal conductors are facing up
![[Pasted image 20250703101901.png]]
==TIP==
	Be extra careful to follow the rules of Cat-5 cabling. That means, among other things, making sure that you use Cat-5 components throughout. The cable and all the connectors must be up to Cat-5 specs. When you attach the connectors, don’t untwist more than one-half inch of cable. And don’t try to stretch the cable runs beyond the 100m maximum. When in doubt, have cable for a 100 Mbps Ethernet system professionally installed.
### Wall jacks and patch panels
The smarter path is to put a wall jack at the user's end of the cable and connect the other end of the cable to a patch panel.
WALL JACK
![[Pasted image 20250703102154.png]]
To connect a computer to the network, you can plug one end of a patch cable (properly called a station cable) into the wall jack and plug the other end into the computer's network interface.
==TIP==
	When you connect the wire to a jack or patch panel, be sure to carefully follow the color-coded label on the jack, and untwist as little of the wire as possible. If you untwist too much of the wire ,the signals that pass through the wire may become unreliable.

### Server rooms and distribution frames
UPS (uninterruptible power supply)
- Server room: The room that contains your servers. Usually, this room will contain one or two equipment racks that hold server computers, disk subsystems, tape backup devices, and UPS units. This room should be equipped with plenty of power outlets on isolated circuits (not shared with wall outlets outside the server room). It will also need plenty of air conditioning, usually a separate A/C unit dedicated to keeping your equipment cool.
- Main distribution frame (MDF): The main switching hub of your network. Technically the term MDF refers to a rack (or collection of racks) that houses the patch panels and switching devices that manage the core of your network. But the term is sometimes used to refer to the room that contains the MDF. This room often doubles as the server room unless your network is very large.
- Intermediate distribution frame (IDF): A remote distribution point for your network. Typically this is for for separate floors, suites within a multi suite building, or separate buildings on a campus. Equipment in an IDF is usually connected directly to the main IDF via a single high-speed cable, preferably capable of carrying 10 Gbps traffic even if the equipment in the MDF and IDF can’t handle 10 Gbps. If the IDF is more than 100 meters from the MDF, fiber cable should be used.

## Installing Switches
Details on installing switch : 
- Installing a switch is usually very simple. Just plug in the power cord and then plug in patch cables to connect the network.
- Each port on the switch has an RJ-45 jack and an LED indicator that lights up when a connection has been established on the port. If you plug one end of a cable into the port and the other end into a computer or other network device, the Link light should come on. If it doesn’t, something is wrong with the cable, the hub (or switch port), or the device on the other end of the cable. 
- Each port may also have an LED indicator that flashes to indicate network activity. If you stare at a switch for a while, you can find out who uses the network most by noting which activity indicators flash the most. 
- The ports may also have an LED that indicates the speed of the connection that has been established. For example, the LED might be light green for a 1GB connection but amber for a 100MB connection. You can use this LED to identify ports that have potential cabling problems, as computers that should connect at 1GB will often connect at 100MB instead if the cable is suspect.
