### Network 
A network is nothing more than two or more computers connected by a cable or by a wireless radio connection so that they can change information.
### Switch
A network switch is used to connect multiple devices together within a single local area network (LAN) using wired connections. (typically ethernet cables)

In modern arena laptop computer have built-in wireless network adaptors as do most desktop computer. If somebody doesn't have the built-in wireless network adaptor a user should purchase network adapter or a device called wireless access point (WAP)

**WAP** : is the wireless access point that is used to takes the internet connection that comes through the wire (from your router) and sprinkles it wirelessly into the air so your WIFI devices can catch it. 
	We take an example when we go to the hotel in corridor at the ceiling we see there is some device is placed that device is WAP

### Difference b/w Router & WAP


| Feature      | Router                                                                                       | Wireless Access Point (WAP)                                                               |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Role | Connects networks (LAN to internet) manages traffic, assigns IP addresses, provides Security | Takes a wired network signal and converts it into a wireless (Wi-Fi ) signal              |
| Brain        | Acts as the brain of your home/office network                                                | Acts as an extension of your network's wireless capabilities                              |
| internet     | Connects your network to the internet                                                        | Does NOT connect to the internet directly. Needs a router to get internet                 |
| Standalone   | Can operate independently (as long as it has an internet connection)                         | Cannot operate independently for internet access. Needs to be connected to a route/switch |
| Common Form  | Often includes a built-in WAP (that's why it provides WI-FI)                                 | Dedicated device for just broadcasting Wi-Fi                                              |
### Typical Network
![[Pasted image 20250617103309.png]]

## Server & Clients
The network computer that contains the hard drives, printers and other resources that are share with other network computers is a server
Any computer that's not a server is a client 
==Dedicated Servers== is a type of server that can perform no other task than network services

### Technical Terms of Network
- #### Network Interface
	Inside any computer attached to a network is a special electronic circuit called the network interface. It has either an external jack into which you can plug a network cable (in short that external jack is a ether socket and cable ethernet cable)
- #### Network Cable
	The network cable physically connects the computer. it Plugs into the network interface card on the back of the computer (LAN cables, ethernet Cables)
	%% The type of network cable most commonly used is twisted-pair cable, so named because it consist of several pairs of wires twisted together in a certain way %%
- #### Network Switch
	A switch is a box with a bunch of cable connectors. Each computer on network is connected by cable to the switch
	%% In early days of twisted-pair networking devices knows as hubs were used rather than switches. The term hub is sometimes used to refer switches %%
- #### Wireless Access Point (WAP)
	The device that enables a computer to connect wirelessly to a network is called a wireless access point. A WAP is a combination of radio transmitter and a radio receiver and has an integrated wired network port.
- #### Router
	A device that is connected to all network is a router which is used to connect two networks, typically your internal network and the internet.
- #### Firewall
	The firewall provides security features that help keep cybercriminals out of your network. 
	The function of a firewall is combined with the function of a router in a single device is called firewall router.

==MULTIPLE COMPUTER SETUP==

%% So in this the setup there is wireless firewall router for safety purpose  %%
==COMPLICATED SETUP== 
![[Pasted image 20250617112726.png]]
%% In this setup the wireless firewall router is changed with wireless access  point and a built in external firewall for the safety purpose that makes the setup more complicated %%

### Network Big and Small
- **Local area networks (LANs):** In this type of network, computers are relatively close together, such as within the same office or building.
	Don’t let the descriptor “local” fool you. A LAN doesn’t imply that a
	network is small. A LAN can contain hundreds or even thousands of
	computers. What makes a network a LAN is that all its connected
	computers are located within close proximity. Usually a LAN is
	contained within a single building, but a LAN can extend to several
	buildings on a campus, provided that the buildings are close to each
	other (typically within 300 feet of each other, although greater
	distances are possible with special equipment).
- **Wide area networks (WANs)**: These networks span a large
	geographic territory, such as an entire city or a region or even a
	country. WANs are typically used to connect two or more LANs that
	are relatively far apart. For example, a WAN may connect an office
	in San Francisco with an office in New York.
	%% The geographic distance, not the number of computers
	involved, makes a network a WAN. If an office in San Francisco and
	an office in New York each has only one computer, the WAN will
	have a grand sum of two computers — but will span more than 3,000
	miles. %%
- **Metropolitan area networks (MANs):** This kind of network is
	smaller than a typical WAN but larger than a LAN. Typically, a
	MAN connects two or more LANs within the same city that are far
	enough apart that the networks can’t be connected via a simple cable
	or wireless connection.
## Bandwidth
It is the max rate at which data can be transferred over the network connection or a communication part from one point to another in a given amount of time

## Peer-To-Peer Network
A network where any computer can function as both a client and a server
